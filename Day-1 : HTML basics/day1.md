## 🧩 Starting From Zero: A Web Dev Story in the AI Era

Today I wrote my first lines of HTML.  
Not just code — but the foundation of the web.

---

### 📚 I learned and practiced:

1. HTML Elements & Tags  
2. “Hello World” structure  
3. Paragraphs, Headings, Lists  
4. Anchor Tags, Image Tags, Attributes  
5. Boilerplate Code & Comments  
6. Practiced the basics to build confidence

## 🤔 But here’s something deeper I’ve been thinking about:

> In 2025, when AI can build websites in seconds…  
> Why should anyone still learn web development?

Here’s why I still chose to learn it — from absolute zero:

---

### 🧠 1. Knowing is Empowering  
AI can build fast, but it can’t explain why your layout is broken, how to fix it, or what your users truly need.  
When you know how things work under the hood, **you’re in control**, not just copying code.

---

### 🎨 2. Creativity Needs Freedom  
Templates are limiting. True creativity comes when you can design, break, build, and rebuild with your own logic — not just drag and drop someone else’s ideas.

---

### 🔧 3. Debugging & Problem-Solving  
When things go wrong (and they will), AI won’t always fix it for you.  
Developers are still the ones who ask:  
> *“What’s the root cause? What’s the best solution?”*  
Those are critical thinking skills AI can’t replace.

---

### 🚀 4. AI is a Co-pilot, Not a Creator  
AI tools (like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) are powerful — but only when you know how to guide them.  
If you don’t know the destination, how can you direct the autopilot?

---

### 🌱 5. Long-Term Growth > Shortcuts  
I’m not learning just to code websites.  
I’m learning to become a **problem-solver, a builder, a thinker**.  
Skills like logic, debugging, and system design never go out of demand — AI or not.

## 👩‍💻 My Reflection

So yes, I’m starting small. From scratch.  
But I believe in learning with depth — because even in the AI era, **human understanding is irreplaceable**.

This is just **Day 1**.  
But it’s the first step in a journey that’s all mine.  
**Committed to progress — learning, building, and growing daily.**
